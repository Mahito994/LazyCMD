  LazyCMD is a CLI setup for Windows and Linux powered by Python
  to make it easy to customize and extend to your own Linkings.
  Rather than having to choose between starting from scratch or needing to do everything manual, LazyCMD offers the best solution of these both - the flexibility
  to tweak the user friendly code as needed, along with the convenience of a pre-configured baseline.
